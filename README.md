# Overview

Welcome to my e-commerce mobile app project! In this endeavor, I aim to develop a user-friendly React Native application that facilitates seamless browsing and purchasing of products. The app will feature at least one screen dedicated to product listings and purchasing options. Additionally, it will be interactive, responding to user inputs such as search queries and purchase selections. To enhance user experience, I'm considering implementing multiple screens for smoother navigation within the app.

The core functionality of the app will include:

- Browsing available products
- Making purchases
- Responsive to user inputs like search queries and selections
- Smooth navigation with multiple screens

My purpose in embarking on this project is twofold. Firstly, I seek to expand my skills as a software engineer by delving into mobile app development using React Native. Secondly, I aim to create a practical application that simulates real-world scenarios, thereby gaining hands-on experience in building functional and user-centric software solutions.

For a detailed demonstration of the app and a walkthrough of the code, please check out the YouTube video linked below.

# Development Environment

For the development of this app, I utilized the following tools and technologies:

- React Native: Framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React.
- Expo: Toolchain for developing and deploying React Native applications.
- Visual Studio Code: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and debugging code.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
- Various React Native libraries: Utilized for handling navigation, state management, and other functionalities as needed.

# Useful Websites

During the development process, I found the following websites particularly helpful:

* [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/)
* [Cross Platform React Native UI toolkit](https://reactnativeelements.com/)
* [Setting up the development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
* [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/overview/)
* [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
* [Android Studio Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)

# Future Work

As I continue to refine and enhance the app, here are some areas I plan to focus on:

* Implementing user authentication and account management features.
* Enhancing the UI/UX design for a more visually appealing and intuitive user experience.
* Integrating payment gateways for secure and seamless transactions.
* Optimizing performance and scalability to accommodate a larger user base.
* Adding features such as product reviews, wishlist, and order tracking to enrich the user experience.
* Refactor the code to make it cleaner to read.
